Hey :)

To run:
    1) Go into directory from terminal
    2) Run "make" command in terminal to compile the program
    3) Run "make run" to launch program OR run "./driver" command from terminal

driver.cpp :
    The driver file that houses the user interface. This contains the event loops and user interaction handling.

DatabaseUtils.cpp :
    This is the main implementation file that contains all the methods used to interact with the file database and the vector database 
    while the program is running. This is accessed from the driver file to provide results to the driver.

DatabaseUtils.h :
    This is the header file to the DatabaseUtils.cpp implementation. It has all the declarations for the utils file to preprocess.
